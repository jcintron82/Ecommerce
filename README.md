This is an ecommerce app I created using Javascript, React.js and CSS. The file/linking structure for the pages is completed via react Routing and the state change animations handled by CSSTransitions from the React Transitions Group. It currently does not have a backend implemented for a "checkout" feature although that is in the plans to be added via using Node.js.
